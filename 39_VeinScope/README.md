# 🧠 VeinScope – Tear Vein Pattern Analysis for Early Disease Mapping

## 🔬 Project Overview

**VeinScope** is a deep learning-powered system that focuses on analyzing close-up images of the human eye to extract detailed **vein structures from the scleral (tear) region**. These extracted patterns are essential for understanding physiological conditions and mapping early indicators of health risks such as : Vein length, Curviness and Density. 

These features can be predictive of fatigue, dehydration, or liver-related stress.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* ✅ Accurately segment the **scleral region** from input eye images.
* ✅ Isolate and segment **fine blood vessels** using deep learning.
* ✅ Extract quantifiable features: **length**, **curviness**, **density**.
* 🧩 Lay groundwork for mapping these features to **medical indicators**.

---

## 🖼️ Sample Input

High-resolution RGB close-up eye images from:

* 📁 **SBVPI Dataset** (~1858 annotated images)
* ⬆️ Or user-uploaded via web interface 

---

## 🛠️ Methods & Pipeline

### 1. Image Preprocessing

* **CLAHE**: Local contrast enhancement.
* **Green Channel Extraction**: Boosts vessel visibility.
* **ROI Isolation**: Focus on scleral region.

### 2. Segmentation (Two-Stage)

* **Model**: DeepLabV3+ with ResNet34 backbone
* **Loss Functions**:

  * Binary Cross Entropy (BCE)
  * Dice Loss (to preserve thin structures)

| Stage       | Description                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Stage 1** | Segment the sclera → `stage1.py`          |
| **Stage 2** | Segment veins within sclera → `stage2.py` |

### 3. Feature Extraction

* 🧵 **Vein Length**: Skeletonization
* 🌀 **Curviness**: Contour-based curvature
* 🔳 **Density**: Ratio of vein to sclera pixels
* 🔴 **Redness**: Differential Red Intensity

### 4. Health Mapping

* ML-based health indicator mapping
* Numerical and visual insights
